# Annunciator
## Project Overview
The Annunciator is a device that subscribes to cloud events and plays pre-recorded audio clips that correspond to data in the event that it subscribes to. 

The Annunciator is intended to be used on a variety of projects that utilize Particleâ€™s (Particle.io) cloud-based publish and subscribe mechanism.  This is an open source
project and this repository includes source code for the software and well as electronic and 2D CAD files for building the hardware.

Complete information about Annunciator operation, theory, construction and configuration and testing can be found in the document: 
  
  Documentation/Annunciator_User_Manual.pdf

## Brief Description
The Annunciator is a self-contained device, including:
- a laser cut enclosure.
- electronics, based upon a Particle Photon microcontroller and a DFRobotDFPlayer mini MP3 player.
- a 3 watt amplifier and an internal loudspeaker.
- Photon software.

The Annunciator subscribes to events that are published to the Particle Cloud.  The event data is parsed to determine the source (deviceID)
of the publication and it plays a voice clip associated with that source.  The voice clips are user defined -- recorded on a micro SD card that
is inserted into the DFRobotDFPlayer mini MP3 player.  The Annunciator flashes a backlit pushbutton when a new message is playing.  The button may be pressed
at any time to replay the last voice clip.

See the "Annunciator_User_Manual" for details.
